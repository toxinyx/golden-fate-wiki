      Heiwa [Golden Fate] is an entirely custom universe primarily conjured up by TOXINYX. This version of Golden Fate is the second rendition of this universe (started development April, 2024), with the first rendition originally being developed in September, 2023. The universe 'officially' became ready-to-release as of [DATE TO BE ADDED]. While much of the lore is of original creation by one individual, it is a community project that allows others to contribute their own lore - those who have added lore are credited here, as well as the lore contributed by them. This is updated each time the Wiki is updated itself.
