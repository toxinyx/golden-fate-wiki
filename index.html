      Heiwa is an entirely custom universe primarily conjured up by <strong>TOXINYX</strong>. This version of Golden Fate is the second rendition of this universe (started development <i>April, 2024</i>), with the first rendition originally being developed in <i>September, 2023</i>. The universe 'officially' became ready-to-release as of <i>[DATE TO BE ADDED]</i>. While much of the lore is of original creation by one individual, it is a community project that allows others to contribute their own lore - those who have added lore are credited <a href="credits.html">here</a>, as well as the lore contributed by them. This is updated each time the Wiki is updated itself.
