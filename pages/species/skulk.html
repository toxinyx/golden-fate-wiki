    <p>
      Skulk Folk, in the world of Heiwa, are <em>not</em> well documented by any region within the country. Information written in this page is not information readily available to the general public, nor to many people of higher status. Some individuals may even be entirely unaware that these creatures exist, or may consider them a long-gone myth.

      Basic Information
    </div>
    <p>
      <center>Skulk are also sometimes referred to as <em>'Dōkutsu no Ikimono <strong>(洞窟の生き物)</strong>'</em>, which translates to '<em>Cave Creatures</em>'.</center>
    </p>

      Naming Schemes
    </div>
    <p>
      The naming conventions of these simplistic rock creatures are just as simple as themselves, and may not be outwardly understandable to the outside viewer. On the <strong>extremely rare occasion</strong> that a Skulk interacts with a human, occasionally the human may choose to give the Skulk a name. This has only ever happened <em>once</em> in hundreds of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst themselves, Skulk have found it difficult to assign each other names due to their incredibly simplistic form of communication and reliance on echolocation. Within the culture, they are instead defined on the 'type' or 'role' of their being, such as being a <em>Hunter</em> Skulk or a <em>Sea</em> Skulk. They may also assign each other simple, identifying words based on a certain formation in their appearance or the strength of their energy. 
      <br><br>
      Names amongst Skulk may include things like <em>Moss</em>, for a Skulk who's body is covered with a large quantity of moss: or <em>Sharp</em> for a Skulk who's rock formation consists primarily of very sharp rocks instead of smooth ones. Names of this nature are almost always one word only for ease of communication.

      Characteristics (Appearance)
    </div>
    <p>
      While Skulk have existed for a very long time, from an evolutionary perspective they have not evolved since nearly perfecting their creation. They have not needed to evolve too much due to their pacifistic nature and tendencies to stay exclusively underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Height and Weight</strong>;
      <br>
      The average height for a Skulk ranges between <em>7'2</em> to <em>7'8</em>.
      <br>
      Skulk that are between <em>6'4</em> and <em>6'10</em> are considered '<strong>runts</strong>'.
      <br>
      Skulk smaller than <em>6'3</em> are typically <strong>defective</strong>. More on defective Skulk is detailed in the biology section of this page.
      <br><br>
      Skulk's weight range varies, but they are typically very heavy. It is difficult to provide an average, as many Skulk are composed of a variety of different organic materials in different percentages. Determining the weight of a Skulk character relies on knowing the weight of the materials the Skulk is made out of and how that may contribute in a group mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Body</strong>;
      <br>
      The Skulk form is composed of the environment around their soul crystal. Due to their living conditions, the majority of Skulk are composed of rock formations, minerals, and other items otherwise found deep in the caves. Some Skulk are naturally formed with significant difference due to the <em>amount of energy</em> that their core produces, causing them to be better suited for certain variants (detailed under 'subspecies'). The Crystals embedded within a Skulk come in a range of colours, typically segregated in type or subspecies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Eyes</strong>;
      The Skulk do not have functioning eyes. Not in the way that regular people do. To see and communicate, they rely primarily on echolocation and vibrations. More of echolocation is devolved in the 'Society' section of this page.
