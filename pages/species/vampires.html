      Naming Schemes
    </div>
    <p>
      The naming schemes of Vampire culture are relatively simple as well as similar to the way Humans name themselves and their children. They tend to follow a <em>two-name naming scheme of Given (First) Name + Surname/Family Name</em>. Middle names are not unheard of, but they are not common amongst people born within Touwara. On occasion, a <em>familial title</em> may be relevant when a Vampire is introducing themselves, but this typically varies dependent on status and introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Given names</strong> are given with intent by parents, holding either some kind of personal meaning or language meaning to how they intend to raise their child to be. They are rarely less than one or two syllables, making Vampiric names longer on average. Names may be commonly shared amongst family members to keep certain traditions or memories alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Surnames</strong> most often come from the male side of families. They are particularly <em>important</em> when it comes to families of higher status or nobility, accompanying significant titles bestowed to the most important people of the family itself. It is regarded as the widest form of recognition in Touwara, sometimes being described as 'sacred' to a person's identity. Abandoning or changing your surname (outside of marriage) is considered an unforgivable betrayal of the family and leads to people being outcasted or outsworn from the culture almost entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Familial titles</strong> are only given to the highest families of Touwara, indicating significant importance of the culture. These 'important' families are reserved for historically-impactful individuals who are descendants of those who have had a strong impact or notable correlation to Vampiric History itself. The titles typically allow individuals to announce themselves to others; they begin with their given names and follow up with the given title. For example, '<em>Kuroyuki, Follower of Shadows</em>' or '<em>Dalaga, the Blood Maiden</em>'.
