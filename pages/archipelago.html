      <strong>平和</strong>; Japanese for ‘Peace’, Heiwa is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean. Formed in <em>492 BES</em> from a series of underwater volcanic eruptions, initially, these islands were not inhabitable by people and instead were left alone for around 87 years. After that, at some point, well-intended travellers decided to send professionals on clean-up duty with the intent of making it a suitable place to live, which they did exactly. It is a collection of four islands, albeit three are significantly smaller than one. The population of Heiwa in it’s entirety is around <em>135,000,000</em>. Over time, each island has seemed to become adapted to fit a specific purpose, but none are segregated from each other — people are free to come and go for the most part.

A notable fact is that children are often taught Japanese alongside English, together. Heiwa tries to be a pinnacle of acceptance and progressiveness, albeit some of the different kingdoms make that a very difficult task to uphold. Many Japanese traditions have carried over from before the Epoch Shift and have been kept alive and well. Though as more people arrived on the Island, culture became diverse and expanded to a lot of different Asian and European countries as well.
